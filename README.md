If your like me who has tried all solutions over stackoverflow and other forums
but still couldn't solve the problem of pushing uitextfield on click of it so that it 
will be above the keyboard, then this is for you.

Download the repositoty as a zip or clone it. Just open it in Xcode if your a intermediate or 
higher level in iOS the code is self explanatory. If any one gets doubt in this, you can messsage
me in github. 

note: to create this repo I have taken help from github.com/sandeeplearner
